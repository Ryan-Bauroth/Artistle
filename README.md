## Description
The Swiftle (https://www.techyonic.co/swiftle), one of the most important contributions to humanity since sliced baguettes, is almost perfect. Yet, it is missing one crucial thing: Customization. This is why we embarked on our journey to create Artistle. Artistle allows users to play a fun song guessing game. All you have to do is pick your favorite artist (presumably Taylor Swift)! Artistle will pick a random song and play it. Now it is up to you to guess the name. Watch out though! You only have 10 seconds. Will you be able to meet Artistle's challenge? Or will you be drowned out by the music? That's up to you to find out!

## How to Play
As Artistle is currently under development, the tutorial is rather lacking. In the mean time, you can learn everything you need to know right here! 
- Go to artistle.net
- Log in with your Spotify Account to access more artists => click the log in button on the right side of the artist input field (optional)
- Type any artist into the artist input field
- Click the pink play button up near the top
- Start guessing (but watch out for the 10 second timer!)

## The Future? (to make us better than sliced baguettes) 
- Multiplayer?
- Use user Playlists?
- Global Highscores?
- Multiple Gamemodes?
- Fun Tutorial?
- Bug fixes? (I know this one is boring but its probably the most important)
