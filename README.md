## Description
The Swiftle (https://www.techyonic.co/swiftle), one of the most import contributions to humanity since sliced baguettes, is almost perfect. Yet, it is missing one crucial thing: Customization. This is why we embarked on our journey to create Artistle. Artistle allows users to play a fun song guessing game. All you have to do is pick your favorite artist (presumably Taylor Swift)! Artistle will pick a random song and play it. Now it is up to you to guess the name. Watch out though! You only have 10 seconds. Will you be able to meet Artistle's challenge? Or will you be drowned out by the music? That's up to you to find out!

## Installation
This project is created with:
* Python 3.11

Dependancies:
```
$ pip install flask
```
```
$ pip install spotipy
```

To run this project, you will need a Spotify Developer account. This lets you access your own Client_Id and Client_Secret variables. Unfortunatly we can't share these with you!
* Create a spotify developer account
* Add your ClientID and Client Secret and now your code should look like this:
```
clientID = "YOUR CLIENT ID"
clientSecret = "YOUR CLIENT SECRET"
```
